# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this project was the need to study for bootcamp; so rather than relying on what may or may not be useful information from stranger, I made my own study guide containing the information I learned through the prework.
I built this project so that I would have a reliable, structured source of all the information I need to know to get ready for bootcamp.
It could save me and other bootcamp students a lot of trouble down the road just because we prepared.
I learned quite a bit through the prework, and the study guide I made is going to help me hold onto to all that important information I may need to come back to recall.

## Usage

The prework study guide is a wonderful source for the basics of bootcamp.
Things like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are just there waiting for you to study, and with the DevTools console you can have a random topic picked for you to study first! Ultimately, it's the best tool you could possibly ask for when preparing for bootcamp.
